The anatomy of a virus

This is the anatomy of a (suspected) virus I received today (2017/03/21) by email.

This is not intended to be used to infect/hack any computer.

Any usage of this project is solely your responsibility.

For the moment I have no idea what this piece of sh*tty source code is doing.

Again: use it at your own risk. Do not use it for any wrongdoing !
